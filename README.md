# Address Book

This is an exercise in Ruby with the Sinatra framework.

## Getting Started

This app will allow a user to input a first and last name, phone number, and e-mail addresses -- all data is stored on local host, and not connected to any sort of database, we do not recommend this for long term storage.


### Prerequisites

To run this, the computer must have ruby installed and an internet connection to download the required Gems.
